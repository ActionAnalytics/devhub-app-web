  <Layout>
    <h1>This page has been replaced by a temporary placeholder.</h1>
    <p>
      For development purposes the page found at {pathname} was not loaded. This message, ofcourse
      should only be visible in development mode. If you are seeing this message under the URL
      https://developer.gov.bc.ca then there is a problem that needs attention!
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      If you are in development mode and are expecting to see a page at {pathname} then this means
      something in the gatsby config is not set up correctly. Most likely you are missing or have an
      invalid api key to one of the many gatsby source plugins the Devhub utilizes
    </p>
